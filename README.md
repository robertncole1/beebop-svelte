Beebop is an app that will allow a caregiver or parent to manage their babyâ€™s schedule or task list and adapt when necessary. My mother is a nanny and my sister is expecting her second child. I want to create a way for both a parent and caregiver to properly communicate so that the child's care comes first. Beebop allows you to put your trust in your caregiver while also keeping you on task as a busy parent.
